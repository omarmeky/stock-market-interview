# Stock Market Web App (Interview Question)

### Background

A leading financial institution has hired you to develop a web application that displays the latest price for a given stock. The application will also show if this is a good stock to invest in right now.

### Requirements

Build an angular application with a search field. When the user searches for a stock ticker, display the stock's latest price. Also, visually indicate if this stock is in the green (positive change) or red (negative change).

Your application will use the following API call to lookup information about a stock:

`http://cors-anywhere-eu.herokuapp.com/http://dev.markitondemand.com/Api/v2/Quote/json`

The endpoint expects a query parameter called `symbol` which takes the stock's ticker. For example, to look up quotes for Apple, you would pass in the value `aapl`.

Although this is a very simple application, please organize it as you would an enterprise level one.

### Submission

Please fork this repository and submit your solution as a pull request. Modify the README with instructions on how to run the application. The application should run with a single command (either `grunt` or `gulp`).

Good Luck! :smiley:

### Run / Open application

This is a simple browser application download app open app/index.html in browser window.
